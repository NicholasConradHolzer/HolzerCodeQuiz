I'm not much of a school/timed test person and until now I've been trying to catch up without a plan and now I have one; instead of trying to get every detail from class and worrying about piling up time that I can never get a dent into; after this I'm just going to work on the projects and learn what I need to in the process of completing them because I don't feel this lateness will reflect me in the long run by any means but I've been too stressed to even enjoy learnign the past few weeks; I dont want a pitty party for an a but don't kick me out I've really been enjoying learning this.
